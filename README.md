# GridWalkingSimulator

Explanation of Program: 

This program initially simulates 2 explorers on a grid (or 'people' lost in a 'forest'), and allows the user to input a grid size and see how long it takes for them to find each other.
The explorers move randomly in one of 8 directions until they both land on the same square. Then, the program will run further simulations using more explorers and display averages and rates of growth for the simulations.
